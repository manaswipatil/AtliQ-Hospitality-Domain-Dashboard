# AtliQ-Hospitality-Domain-Dashboard

***The Brief***

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

**Task:**

You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on creating dashboard with relevant insights.

***What I learned:***

- The data was provided in csv format files for Hotels, Rooms and bookings. The data was checked and cleaned, and tranformations were performed to create calculated columns and measures with common functions and formulas.
- Build a relational data model, creating active relations between tables and understanding cardinality and filter flow.
- Designed an interactive dashboard to visualize data using charts and visuals. Created a new visual using matrix table as Calendar. 
- Created page navigation, custom tooltip.
